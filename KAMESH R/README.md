# Hate Speech Detection Project

The **Hate Speech Detection Project** focuses on identifying and categorizing language that promotes hatred or violence toward individuals or groups based on characteristics like race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. Using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, our model analyzes text from platforms like social media and forums to detect hate speech with high accuracy. 

The main goal is to provide a tool that helps platforms filter out harmful content, making online spaces safer and more respectful for all users.
