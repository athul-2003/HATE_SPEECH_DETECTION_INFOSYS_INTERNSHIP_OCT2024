## **Introduction**
Hate speech is a growing issue in online spaces, targeting individuals and groups based on factors like race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation.  
The **Hate Speech Detection Project** addresses this challenge by identifying and categorizing harmful language that incites hate or violence in digital environments.  
The goal is to create a safer and more inclusive online space by detecting and moderating hate speech, promoting healthier digital communities.

## **Objective**
To develop an accurate model for detecting hate speech in online text data.

---

## **Methodology**
We leverage **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to analyze and classify text.

---

## **Key Features**
1. **Data Collection**  
   - **Source:** Curated dataset from Mendeley Data.  
   - **Scope:** Contains over 200,000 samples for comprehensive representation.  
   - **Accessibility:** Open-access dataset to support further research and development.

2. **Balanced Dataset**  
   - **Non-Hate Speech:** 100,452 instances  
   - **Hate Speech:** 98,249 instances  

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - **Text Cleaning:** Removes irrelevant elements like punctuation and HTML tags.  
   - **Lowercasing:** Ensures text consistency.  
   - **Tokenization:** Breaks sentences into individual words (tokens).  
   - **Lemmatization & Stemming:** Reduces words to their root forms for analysis.

4. **Feature Extraction**  
   - **Objective:** Transform raw text data into numerical representations for ML models.  
   - **Approach:** Used **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to highlight words specific to hate speech.

5. **Train-Test Split**  
   - **Training Set:** 80% of the data.  
   - **Testing Set:** 20% of the data.  
   - **Validation:** 20% of the training data.

## **Model Building**
Several models were trained and evaluated:  
- **Logistic Regression:** Predicts the probability of a text being hate speech (Accuracy: 81%).  
- **Random Forest:** Combines decision trees for improved accuracy (Accuracy: 81%).  
- **Naive Bayes:** Uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the likelihood (Accuracy: 79%).  
- **Deep Learning:** Advanced neural networks capable of learning complex patterns (Accuracy: 83%).

---

## **Deployment**
The model is deployed as a **Streamlit Web App**, making it accessible and interactive.  
- **Platform:** Streamlit Cloud.  
- **How It Works:** Users enter text, and the system predicts if it contains hate speech.

## **Impact**
The Hate Speech Detection Project contributes to:  
1. **Online Safety:** Protecting individuals and groups from abuse.  
2. **Support for Moderation:** Assisting platforms in managing harmful content.  
3. **Community Well-Being:** Promoting healthier digital spaces.
